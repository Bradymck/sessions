# Sessions is an experiment in music, art and open source development.We are starting with basic tipping in exchange for micro tasks. The session will involve listeners the opportunity to engage with artists while they write a song. 

We will be automatically distributing rewards to all contributors in the form of prizes and sometimes accrual payments. We will start with a basic points system though to keep it simple. 

Though the ultimate goal is to build an open value network. as things progress and build value. The rewards will also mature. 

Depending on the success of a sessions produced song, it could allow the artist to have a single payment address for the session. Programmable payment platforms can then be used to pragmatically distribute rewards. 

For now, basic open source tools are being collected here troll begin building what will be needed to move this forward.  

Basic complainants we are starting with is Bitsplitter from tokenly. And pro tip to subscribe to contributor payment addresses. We will be starting simple for now. Connecting payment addresses for participants. Working up tip the reward stage and eventually to an instructor stage with apps and even games begging used to find different caused our projects. 

This is an experiment. Nothing is guaranteed so we will begin so simple we will not even speak of Blackstone into a development stage is reached when infrastructure is needed.

Until the instructor stage is reached. We will not speak a word about money beyond casual tipping for tasks. Truth be told most of us involved are Brockchain enthusiasts. So much so many of us can't also at night. So this brings us to the money box. If anyone at sessions mentions money our anything related, we put some in the box.

music is going to be fundamentally changed by  technology. However, we are at a key moment that we must step away and list focus on this new tool. So it may be used properly. So beyond github, you will rarely hear talk about money but you can guarantee this is a powerful tool that anyone who understands it should be using.
